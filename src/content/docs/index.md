One of the core objectives for this project is the development of a software package to enable computationally efficient phase-field modeling of quantum materials.

The software, which we have termed the Quantum Phase-field Open-source Package (or Q-POP for short), will enable researchers to study quantum materials and phase transitions, such as super-conductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and strongly-correlated materials, using the phase-field method using robust, state-of-the-art multi-grid methods to solve the underlying evolution and equilibrium equations. We are utilizing the FEniCS project to help in the discretization and solving of our partial differential equations.

At current, we have developed a suite of solvers for a variety of equilibrium equations, such as mechanical equilibrium, which will be implemented in the final package. In addition, we are nearly complete with the development of an initial alpha release of the software with examples for the phase-field modeling of metal-insulator transitions, for which we have also written a manual.

The flexible, easily-extendible, and maintainable phase-field modules we are generating will provide a boon to the open-source phase-field community, and lead the charge into the next generation of high-performance computing resources.
